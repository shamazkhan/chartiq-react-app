<p>The candles are either filled or hollow based on the price action within the candle.
<p>Hollow candles are drawn when the close is higher than the open (upward intra-session price action).

		title: "Heikin-Ashi Chart",
		content: `<p>Heikin-Ashi charts are time series charts that resemble candle charts. In a normal candle chart, each candle is calculated independent of the other candles. However, in Heikin-Ashi charts, the candles appear to link together because of how their OHLC values are calculated:
<p>Open = the mean of the previous open and the previous close.
<p>High = the maximum of the current high, open, and close.
<p>Low = the minimum of the current low, open, and close.
<p>Close = the mean of the current open, close, high, and low.
<p>Upward trends are indicated by green candles with wicks on top, but almost no wick on bottom. Downward trends are indicated by red candles with wicks on the bottom and almost no wick on top. Reversal points are indicated by candles, red or green, with small bodies and wicks on top and bottom. This chart type can spot trends more clearly and easily than regular candle charts.`
	},
	chart_type_kagi: {
		title: "Kagi Chart",
		content: `<p>Kagi charts appear as vertical bars connected by small horizontal segments at right angles. Kagi charts are independent of time; they progress forward based on price action. Thick green lines, called yang bars, indicate that a price has broken out above the previous yin’s high price. Thin red bars, called yin bars, indicate that the price has fallen below the previous yang’s low. Unlike the other chart types, the colors of kagi lines do not directly communicate upward or downward trends.
<p>Bars move upward or downward depending on closing prices. A bar will shift direction when a reversal limit is reached. Reversal limits are input by the user as a fixed percentage of the price. For example, imagine you have a stock valued at $10 and you are drawing a kagi chart with a reversal of 10%. Depending on what trend was established, a cumulative $1 movement in the opposite direction will break the current trend and cause a reversal.
<p>Kagi Configuration: Kagi charts can be customized. Pressing the AUTO SELECT button of the customization dialog box sets the reversal limit to one of two defaults: if the chart is daily, a reversal of 4% is set; if the chart is intraday, a reversal of 0.4%.`
	},
	chart_type_linebreak: {
		title: "Line Break Chart",
		content: `<p>Line break charts appear as vertical bars that ascend and descend. These charts are time independent and are determined only by price action. Ascending bars are colored green and indicate upward price action. Descending bars are colored red and indicate downward price action.
<p>Line break charts are constructed by looking at the close of a bar and comparing it to a previous bar’s close; which bar it is compared to is determined by the user (see below). If the current bar’s close is higher than the one it is being compared to, a green ascending bar is drawn. If the current bar’s close is lower than the one that it is being compared to, a red descending bar is drawn. If the current close is the same, or if the price does not move enough in one direction or the other to signify a reversal, then no bar is drawn. 
<p>Line Break Configuration: Line break charts default to a value of three, meaning that it compares the current bar’s close to the bar that came two periods earlier.`

<p>Renko charts are constructed from a series of bricks placed sequentially upward using green blocks or downward based on user-defined fluctuations in price.

<p>The objective is to capture directional price trends without the impact of time.
<p>A new column is formed when price reverses a set number of boxes, that is a multiple of the box size.

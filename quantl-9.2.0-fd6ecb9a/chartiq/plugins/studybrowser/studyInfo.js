		description:
			"The Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator calculates the strength of the market over time, based on the net change in price for each period compared to its prior period. When the net change is positive, the maximum difference between the close and the low or the close and the prior close is added to the A/D. Conversely, if the net change is negative the maximum difference between the close and the high or the prior close is subtracted from the A/D.You can use the A/D to analyze money flow. In this case, the positive or negative direction is multiplied by the volume for the current period.\nNote: The A/D uses all the data loaded into the chart. Typically this is 200 bars prior to the first bar shown. As the chart is compressed or panned it will load more data forcing the A/D to recalculate and will produce different values. That said, the pattern of the A/D will remain the same."

	"Accumulative Swing Index": {
		description:
			"The Accumulative Swing Index indicator (ASI) aggregates all the prior Swing Index (SI) values providing a longer term tool to support a swing trading strategy. The ASI is designed to help simplify market interpretation and leverage the sensitivity of the SI which helps detect potential changes in trend.\nNote: The ASI uses all the data loaded into the chart. Typically this is 200 bars prior to the first bar shown. As the chart is compressed or panned it loads more data forcing the ASI to recalculate and will produce different values. That said, the pattern of the ASI will remain the same.\nThe Accumulative Swing Index was developed by Welles Wilder.\nRelated Study: Swing Index"
	},
	"ADX/DMS": {
		description:
			"ADX (Average Directional Index) or DMS (Directional Movement System) uses Directional Movement (DM) calculations to identify trends and gauge the strength of those trends. Directional Movement (DM) is defined as the largest part of the current period`s price range that lies outside the previous period`s price range. Each period will either be positive (PDM = larger range above previous range), negative (NDM = larger range below previous range), or zero if moves above and below the previous period`s range are equal or price stays within the previous day`s range (an inside bar).\nA smoothed average of both positive and negative directional movement are calculated and then divided by the Average True Range (ATR) to derive the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI). Each period will have only one result, either plus, minus or zero. +DI increases and -DI decreases during rising trends and vice-versa in down trends. The DI Difference (DI) is the sum of +DI and -DI. Accordingly, the DI Histogram will oscillate around zero as the market trends.\nThe Average Directional Index (ADX) is a simple moving average of the absolute value of the DI. The ADX is a non-directional trend analysis tool. Low values indicate the market has consolidated and is ready to trend, whereas high values indicate a strong trend has been well established and may be nearing an end.\nThe ADX/DMS study displays the ADX line as well as the +DI and -DI. In addition, there is an option to display a histogram of the spread between +DI and -DI which serves as a momentum oscillator."

	Alligator: {
		description:
			"The Alligator indicator uses three smoothed moving averages (SMMAs) named Jaw, Teeth, and Lips. Each one is offset forward (into the future) to indicate convergence/divergence relationships. The SMMAs are calculated on the Median Price. When the market is trending, the Alligator lines will diverge. When the three lines are close together, the Alligator indicates consolidation. The Gator oscillator is often used as a companion study to better understand the divergence/convergence between the three SMMAs.\nThe Alligator study can hide its Jaw, Teeth, and Lips lines, enabling users to show only the Fractal Arrows to emphasize trading signals.\nThe Alligator indicator was invented by Bill Williams.\nRelated Study: Gator Oscillator"

	"ATR Trailing Stops": {
		description:
			"ATR Trailing Stop highlights a reversal in trend by plotting a stop point based upon recent market volatility. Average True Range (ATR) is used to adjust the stop point based upon recent market volatility. The trailing stop will continue to increase in a rising market, and decrease in a down market. If the trend stalls or the market consolidates, the stop will stabilize at a level until the trend resumes or crosses through the stop level. ATR Trailing Stop flips to the invert when price corrects below/above the stop line.\nCalculate the ATR and then apply the multiplier. For an up trend, subtract from previous close. For a down trend, add to the previous close.\nRelated Study: Average True Range (ATR), ATR Bands, True Range (TR)"

	"Balance of Power": {
		description:
			"The Balance of Power is a moving average of the internal strength of each bar. The internal strength is measured by deriving a ratio of each bar's close-open relative to its high-low range. The highest/lowest value for any bar 1/-1, which occurs if the market opens on the low and closes on the high, and vice-versa in a down market. If the close equals the open the value for the bar is zero, indicating the power is balanced between the bulls and the bears."

	Beta: {
		description:
			"Beta measures the volatility of returns for one security against those of a benchmark security, usually a market index. It is often used as a measure of risk of a security relative to the market. A Beta greater than 1.0 will tend to move up or down faster than the benchmark security."

	"Bollinger Bandwidth": {
		description:
			"The Bollinger Bandwidth measures the difference (spread) between the upper and lower Bollinger Bands. As the market trends and price dispersion increases the bands will widen, thereby providing a measure of volatility. When the Bollinger Bandwidth is low, due to a market consolidation, it is often considered a setup for a trend.\nBollinger Bands were created by John Bolinger.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter.\nRelated Study: Bollinger Bands, Bollinger %b"
	},
	"Center Of Gravity": {
		description:
			"The Center of Gravity (COG) is a leading oscillator created by John Ehlers in 2002. It is used to identify support and resistance. It is constructed using a weighted moving average, which according to its creator, was analogous to the weighted coordinates of an object&#8217;s mass distribution. It is accompanied by a Signal line, a simple moving average.\nClaiming to have zero lag, COG allows for clear indication of reversals due to the smoothing effect of the indicator. When the COG line crosses above the signal line, it is an indication of an upturn. When the COG line crosses below the signal line, it is an indication of a market downturn."
	},
	"Chaikin Money Flow": {
		description:
			"The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator is a moving sum of volume which is weighted by where price closes within its range. The indicator oscillates around 0, with positive amounts indicating a bullish trend, and negative amounts indicating a bearish trend.\nThe weight is called a “multiplier”, which ranges from -1 for a close at the low to +1 for a close at the high. A multiplier of -1 implies all the volume is negative, and is subtracted from the moving sum. In contrast, if the multiplier equals +1, all the volume for the period is added to the moving sum.\nThe Chaikin Money Flow was developed by Marc Chaikin.\nRelated Study: On Balance Volume, Twiggs Money Flow"
	},
	"Chaikin Volatility": {
		description:
			"Chaikin Volatility measures the rate of change, in percentage terms, of a moving average of the high-low range. Higher values indicate the volatility (as measured by range) has been increasing relative to itself. The values are unbounded.\nThe Chaikin Volatility was developed by Marc Chaikin."
	},
	"Chande Forecast Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Chande Forecast Oscillator (CFO) measures the spread, in percentage terms, between the market price and a Time Series Moving Average (TSMA) which is a n-period moving linear regression using the “least squares fit” method. The oscillator is above zero when the price is above the CFO and less than zero if it is below. The oscillator is quite responsive to changes in trend as the TSMA follows price quite closely.\nThe Chande Forecast Oscillator was introduced by Tushar Chande.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter.\nRelated Study: Moving Average Deviation"

	"Chande Momentum Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) compares, in percentage terms, the sum of all recent one-period price changes divided by the sum of the absolute values of the one-period price changes over the same time period. The range of the CMO is bounded between -100 and +100.\nThe Chande Momentum Oscillator was introduced by Tushar Chande and Stanley Kroll."

	"Choppiness Index": {
		description:
			"The Choppiness Index (CI) is a non-directional trend analysis indicator which rises during a consolidation and falls as the market trends. The CI is a bounded range between 0 - 100. The higher the value, the less the market is trending.\nThe Choppiness Index was created by Australian commodities trader E.W. Driess."
	},
	"Commodity Channel Index": {
		description:
			"The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) study measures market momentum by deriving a price oscillator and normalizing it by the deviation of price from its average. Specifically, it uses the average of the high, low and close for the period (HLC3, also referred to as “typical price”) and subtracts the “n” period moving average of HLC3, this quantity is then divided by the mean deviation of price from the simple moving average (SMA). By measuring price relative to its SMA, the CCI effectively captures the acceleration and deceleration of a market trend.\nCCI is an unbounded oscillator. A factor of 0.015 is used to center the series so that +100 and -100 (default threshold values) may be used to identify Overbought and Oversold conditions. When CCI equals 0 it indicates that price is equal to the SMA. The Commodity Channel Index was developed by Donald Lambert."
	},
	"Coppock Curve": {
		description:
			"The Coppock Curve is calculated by first summing two rate of change measures, one with a long period and second with a short period. The Coppock Curve is a weighted moving average of this sum.\nThe Coppock Curve was created by Edwin Coppock.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter."
	},
	"Correlation Coefficient": {
		description:
			"The Correlation Coefficient is a statistical measure used to calculate the strength and direction of the linear relationship (or the statistical relationship) between two data sets. For charting, it is between two traded instruments and the result is recalculated for each period in the same way a moving average “moves” through time using fresh data.\nThe value ranges between -1 to +1. The positive and negative correlation coefficient represents the direct (positive) and inverse (negative) linear correlation or statistical relationship between the data sets. That is, a positive correlation indicates two instruments have traded in the same direction, whereas a negative correlation implies they have traded in opposite directions. If the correlation is close to zero or equal to zero then the data sets are considered uncorrelated."
	},
	"Darvas Box": {
		description:
			"The Darvas Box is a support/resistance indicator and a trading methodology rolled into one. It is an overlay study meant to indicate stocks that are trading at new highs by highlighting recent highs and lows to indicate entry points and placement of stop-losses.\nThe rules of drawing the Darvas Box are:\n<div class=ciq-info-panel-indent>&#8226; Boxes are drawn around bars where an “all time high” was reached followed by 3 successive higher lows, and the high of the first bar was not broken by a higher high.\n&#8226; The box continues until either the original high is broken out, or the lowest of the 2 successive lows is broken below.\n&#8226; User can configure if high/low or close breaks the box.\n&#8226; User can configure if “Ghost boxes” are shown.\n<div class=ciq-info-panel-indent>&#8227; These will form on an upwards breakout of a Darvas.\n&#8227; The low of the Ghost box will be the same value as the high of the Darvas which was broken.\n&#8227; The height of the Ghost box will be the same as the Darvas box.\n&#8227; The width of the Ghost box will be either:\n<div class=ciq-info-panel-indent>&#8259; The width of the Darvas box\n&#8259; Until the Ghost box is broken below\n&#8259; Until the Ghost box is broken above, in which case another Ghost box forms with the lower left corner at the upper right corner of the preceding Ghost box.</div></div>\n&#8226; User can define if arrow is drawn pointing to a volume spike and at what percentage that will be.\n&#8226; User can configure period defining all time high.\n&#8226; User can define a price minimum below which boxes will not form.\n&#8226; User can define whether “Stop Levels” are drawn and how far below the box low. Stop levels cannot be lowered, only raised (or broken).</div>\nWhile the indicator will run on any bar interval it is best used on higher intervals (i.e., weekly/monthly) with securities in a strong trend.\nThe logic behind the construction of the Darvas Box is somewhat complex but the usage is fairly straightforward. Once you have a closed box (a blue box assuming the default settings) you wait for a close (or a high) above the box on higher volume for a bullish signal or a close (or a low) below the box on higher volume for a bearish signal. The stop would generally be set just past the other side of the box. New boxes which form while you are in a trade provide an opportunity to build on a position upon a new breakout as well as updating a trailing stop level based on the most recent box. When used strictly as an indicator, the Darvas Box is an excellent mechanism to identify trading ranges on all bar intervals."

	"Depth of Market": {
		description:
			"The Depth of Market (DOM) study overlays a vertical market depth chart over the price chart. This DOM shows the supply and demand by indicating the number of bids (buy orders) and asks (sell orders) for each price level surrounding the current market price. The overlay of DOM on the price chart supports blending of technical analysis with the current supply and demand data.\nThe DOM study requires Level 2 market data."
	},
	"Detrended Price Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO) seeks to remove trend information from the data. It does this by taking a moving average and shifting it to the left. It then subtracts the average from the time period from the close of that time period to arrive at the result.\nThe DPO will not be displayed on the most recent period as the moving average is shifted to the left. The resulting DPO plot will emphasize the movement of the security above and below the moving average while filtering out the general trends. The DPO is often used to help find cycles in the market by identifying peaks and troughs.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter."
	},
	"Disparity Index": {
		description:
			"The Disparity Index (DI) measures the distance of price from a moving average in percentage terms.

	},
	"Ease of Movement": {
		description:
			"The Ease of Movement (EOM) indicator is designed to measure volume`s impact on price. EOM first divides the volume by the period`s high-low Range, essentially distributing the volume equally across the high-low range. This value is then used as the denominator to measure the impact on the price change. A large change in price implies the volume was able to move the market.\nEOM is an unbounded oscillator. A rising EOM indicates the market is easily moving upward, and the converse is true on the downside.\nThe Ease of Movement indicator was developed by Richard W. Arms, Jr."
	},
	"Ehler Fisher Transform": {
		description:
			"The Ehler Fisher Transform (EFT) is designed to convert prices into a Gaussian normal distribution based on the recent n-period trading range. The EFT is an unbounded oscillator with a trailing Trigger line that is the EFT with a lag of 1 period. The EFT is designed to reduce volatility of the indicator, but still provide timely signals of change in trend.\nThe Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers."

		description:
			"The Elder Force Index (EFI) is a money flow based oscillator that multiplies the period`s volume times the price change thereby showing the strength of the price movement. EFI is an unbounded oscillator. A rising EFI indicates volume is driving prices higher, and a declining EFI indicates volume is pushing the market lower.\nThe Elder Force Index was developed by Alexander Elder."
	},
	"Elder Impulse System": {
		description:
			"The Elder Impulse System (EIS) combines net changes in an exponential moving average (EMA) of price with net changes in the MACD histogram to produce bullish and bearish signals applied to the chart using paintbars. The result is a colored bar chart where the colors represent bullish, bearish or neutral signals. Bullish (green) signals appear when the values of both the EMA and the MACD Histogram increase from the prior period. Conversely, if both decrease then it is a bearish (red) signal. If they move in opposite directions then it is a neutral signal (blue).\nThe Elder Impulse System was developed by Alexander Elder."

	"Fractal Chaos Bands": {
		description:
			"The Fractal Chaos Bands are designed to identify breakouts and trend persistence based on the market making new Highs/Lows. An upside breakout is identified when the current high is the Highest High when compared to the prior two highs, in which case the Upper Band holds its last value and moves sideways. If the market is not trending, either up or down, then the Upper Band will display the high from two bars ago. The reverse is done for the Lower Band.\nRelated Study: Fractal Chaos Oscillator"

	"Fractal Chaos Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Fractal Chaos Oscillator has three states -1, 0, +1. A value of 0 indicates the market is consolidating. A value of +1 indicates a change in the upper range of the market, as best seen using the Upper Fractal Chaos Band. A value of -1 indicates a change in the lower range of the market, as best seen using the Lower Fractal Chaos Band.\nThe Fractal Chaos Oscillator was developed by E. W. Dreiss.\nRelated Study: Fractal Chaos Bands"
	},
	"Gator Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Gator Oscillator (GO) is derived from the Alligator indicator. It plots two histograms in opposite directions that highlight the divergence/convergence between the three SMMAs used in the Alligator: Jaws, Teeth, and Lips. The positive histogram is the absolute value of the (Jaw - Teeth). The negative histogram is the absolute value of the (Teeth - Lips) multiplied by -1.\nGreen histogram bars indicate the averages are diverging, highlighting acceleration of the trend. Red bars indicate convergence of the averages showing the trend is losing strength. Compression of the histograms helps determine when a market is consolidating.\nAlthough the GO can be used separately, it is most often combined with the Alligator as they complement each other in giving a more complete overview of current market conditions. The GO shows the absolute degree of convergence/divergence of the three moving averages plotted by Alligator study."

	"GoNoGo - Icons + Trend": {
		description:
			"Trend identification is arguably the most important concept in technical analysis. By blending objective, widely proven statistical indicators together with the foundational principles of technical analysis, GoNoGo Trend® colors the price action of any security according to the strength of its trend.\nDisciplined investing is simple, but not easy. Many traders and investors are overwhelmed by the often redundant, occasionally contradictory, and ever-complicated battery of indicators. GoNoGo Charts help investors understand the direction and continuity of price trends for any security, any asset class, across any time frame. By blending objective principles of technical analysis and the most widely used statistical measures, GoNoGo Charts remove “indicator overload.” Investors remain focused on what matters most – price – while colors of each bar or candle reflect the strength of the trend.\nFinancial markets can be complicated, your charts don’t have to be.\nFree from the clutter of many technical charts, GoNoGo Trend is easy to interpret. It paints the price bars bright blue when its unique mix of inputs signal the strongest bullish environment. When slightly less bullish, the color turns to aqua. This can happen at the start of a new trend, or after bright blue bars, indicating that the trend may be weakening. The amber bars represent uncertainty, often appearing in the transition from bull trend to bear trend and vice versa. The lower intensity bearish color is pink, and the darker purple appears when the bearish trend intensifies.\nGoNoGo Charts highlight low-risk opportunities for trend participation and alert investors to short-term countertrend corrections with intuitive icons directly in the price action.\nThe resurgence of momentum in the direction of the trend is an excellent entry opportunity, or the chance to scale up positions. GoNoGo Icons illuminate these events on the chart with green or red solid circles. When GoNoGo Trend is painting blue bars, a green solid circle will appear above price each time GoNoGo Oscillator finds support at zero. When GoNoGo Trend is painting purple bars, a red solid circle will appear each time GoNoGo Oscillator hits resistance at the zero-line from below.\nContrarily, within a “Go” trend, a security’s momentum may reach overbought levels, then fall back toward the zero-line. While in a “NoGo” trend, a security’s momentum may fall to extreme oversold levels, and then cool. As the momentum calculations retreat from extreme overbought or oversold levels, GoNoGo Icons highlight the possible countertrend correction in price."

		description:
			"Momentum goes hand in hand with trend identification. GoNoGo Oscillator® helps investors understand the velocity of price change, giving valuable information about the strength of a trend and the market’s conviction in it. Strong or increasing momentum provides confirmation of a trend while decelerating momentum gives the investor a leading indication of weakness and the potential for reversal.\nGoNoGo Oscillator® blends several popular momentum ideas together to provide the user with meaningful momentum analysis. As an oscillator, the indicator’s values range above and below zero, from -6 to +6, with extreme positive values being considered overbought and extreme negative values, oversold. Within trend, a security’s momentum may reach overbought/oversold levels, then fall back toward the zero-line, and then rally again. A break above/below zero would indicate divergent momentum – unsustainable for a healthy trend.\nIn addition, GoNoGo Oscillator’s color features a change from light blue to dark blue when volume is heavier than normal. Confirming or diverging volume readings give investors additional insight at pivotal decision points."

Meaning, when enthusiasm wanes within a trending market, GoNoGo Oscillator® provides an objective point of support/resistance for momentum at the zero line.\nWhere there is no excessive buying or selling, price action stagnates, volatility declines, markets move sideways, and GoNoGo Oscillator® rests at the zero line. This volatility compression is highlighted by GoNoGo Squeeze®. A visual grid in the oscillator panel climbs as momentum remains neutral reaching extremes with prolonged reduction in volatility. Like a coiled spring, researchers have shown that following these stalemates between buyers and sellers, a breakout can be expected."

The TSF is a moving series which plots the forecasted value of the derived trend line each period, thereby following the market like a moving average.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter.\nRelated Study: Linear Regression Forecast"

	"Trade Volume Index": {
		description:
			"Trade Volume Index (TVI) adds a price movement threshold parameter to the On Balance Volume (OBV) study. Accordingly, like OBV, TVI is a cumulative total of the volume with the difference being that it only sums the volume on periods when price rises to a minimum threshold and subtracts the volume on down periods that exceed the threshold. TVI is often used as a confirmation indicator that shows if the volume activity is supporting the trend.\nRelated Study: On Balance Volume"
	},
	"Trend Intensity Index": {
		description:
			"The Trend Intensity Index (TII) is a ratio of the sum of price deviation above a simple moving average relative to the sum of the price deviation below a simple moving average. The TII is a bounded oscillator between 0 and 100. The TII will move to an extreme value during strong trends."
	},
	TRIX: {
		description:
			"The TRIX Oscillator measures the percent change of the triple exponential moving average (TEMA) of the close from one bar to the next. A central benefit of the TRIX oscillator when compared to others is it is quite smooth, providing greater clarity of the signals.\nThe TRIX Oscillator was developed by Jack Hutson."
	},
	"True Range": {
		description:
			"The derivation of the True Range (TR) captures gap openings that are missed by traditional high-low ranges.\nRelated Study: ATR Bands, Average True Range (ATR)"
	},
	"Twiggs Money Flow": {
		description:
			"Developed by Colin Twiggs, the Twiggs Money Flow (TMF) indicator is a moving sum of volume, displayed as an oscillator, weighted by where price closes within its range. The indicator oscillates around 0, with positive amounts indicating a bullish trend, and negative amounts indicating a bearish trend.\nThe TMF is a derivation of the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator, which is in turn derived from the Accumulation/Distribution line. There are two primary differences between TMF and CMF. The first is that the TMF volume multiplier is derived using the True Range instead of the H-L range. The second is that TMF is derived using moving averages instead of cumulative volume. Consequently, these two indicators produce similar results."
	},
	"Typical Price": {
		description:
			"The Typical Price indicator is a simple moving average (SMA) of the mean of the high, low, and close.\nNote: The term “Typical Price” is used throughout technical analysis in other studies where it refers to HLC3, whereas the Typical Price Indicator is an SMA of HLC3."
	},
	"Ulcer Index": {
		description:
			"The Ulcer Index measures the depth of a drawdown from a recent high. Specifically, as stated by Peter Martin: it is the square root of the mean of the squared percentage drawdowns in value. The squaring effect penalizes large drawdowns proportionately more than small drawdowns.\nThe Ulcer Index was developed by Peter Martin and Byron McCann.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter."
	},
	"Ultimate Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Ultimate Oscillator (UO) indicator is designed to improve the Overbought and Oversold signals by capturing the market`s momentum across three different time periods (i.e., Cycles). The UO effectively averages oscillators across three periodicities. The UO is a bounded oscillator with values between 0 and 100. Divergences between the UO and market price are often considered an important signal that the trend is failing and will reverse.\nThe Ultimate Oscillator was developed by Larry Williams."
	},
	"Valuation Lines": {
		description:
			"The Valuation Line is an average of all the data points displayed on the chart. Accordingly, the value will change as the data on the chart is panned left/right or expanded or compressed. Any Field shown on the chart may be selected as the input, including other studies. Three average types are supported: Mean, Median, Harmonic.\nStandard Deviation bands may also be displayed above/below the average.\nNOTE: This study can be applied to other studies by using the Field parameter."
	},
	"Vertical Horizontal Filter": {
		description:
			"The Vertical Horizontal Filter (VHF) is a measure of trend extension and consolidation. It is a ratio of high-low over a range of time divided by the sum of the absolute value of price changes. Higher values indicate a stronger trend, lower values indicate a consolidation.\nThe Vertical Horizontal Filter was created by Adam White."
	},
	"Volatility Cone": {
		description:
			"The Volatility Cone indicator displays a cone projected forward with the likely price range based on recent volatility. Either historical or implied volatility (if available) may be used as the input. The Volatility Projection Cone is a forward-looking study that allows users to blend information from the options market with other technical analysis tools."

	"Volume Oscillator": {
		description:
			"The Volume Oscillator (VO) measures the spread between two exponential moving averages of volume, which is similar to a Price Oscillator using volume as the field."
	},
	"Volume Profile": {
		description:
			"Volume Profile, sometimes called “volume at price”, overlays horizontal volume bars extending from the y-axis. It is designed to show the volume traded at each price level over the span of the chart. Volume Profile is often used to identify possible support and resistance.\nThe High-Low range for the date:time range displayed is divided by the number of buckets resulting in a high and low of each bucket. For each time period, the volume value is examined and that volume is placed into the bucket whose high value < volume value and low value > volume value.\nThe Volume Profile only considers the range of data shown on the screen and will change if the chart is stretched, squeezed, or scrolled back or forward in time. By combining volume and price, the user can identify high-volume price ranges which indicate price levels where significant volume was transacted indicating a balanced market. These levels are likely to provide support or resistance in the future."

	"Vortex Indicator": {
		description:
			"The Vortex Indicator (VI) evaluates the strength of the trend by measuring the upside and downside price action. Accordingly, the VI derives an Uptrend line (+VI) and a Downtrend line (-VI). Positive price movement is measured over two bars by subtracting the prior low from the current high. The +VI is the sum of the upside values divided by the sum of the True Range (TR) for each bar.\nConversely, negative price movement subtracts the prior high from the current low. The -VI is the sum of the downside values divided by the sum of the TR for each bar.\nThe crossover of the +VI and -VI is often considered the signal of a new trend in the direction of the rising VI line.\nThe Vortex Indicator was created by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman."
	},
	VWAP: {
		description:
			"The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is an intraday moving average that is weighted by the volume. It is used to get a view of the fair value of the market based on the price at which volume was executed on average throughout a single day&#8217;s trading session. The calculation starts when trading opens and ends when it closes.\nThe VWAP multiplies the volume for each period times the typical price (HLC3). Because it also divides by the total volume, the VWAP is considered distinct from the simple moving average (SMA).\nVWAP is often used as a confirmation tool in combination with other indicators, and has many uses. For example, a stock trading at prices below the VWAP may be seen as undervalued.\nRelated Study: Anchored VWAP"

	"Weighted Close": {
		description:
			"The Weighted Close indicator is a simple moving average of the period`s high, low, and close, with close receiving double weight given its importance of mark-to-market."
	},
	"Williams %R": {
		description:
			"The Williams %R indicator normalizes prices within a range by measuring the percentage distance of the last price relative to the upper and lower bounds of its recent trading range. The result is multiplied by -100 and is plotted on a scale of -100 to zero.\nThe Williams %R indicator was developed by Larry Williams.\nRelated Study: Stochastics"
	},
	ZigZag: {
		description:
			"The ZigZag study identifies price swings of a predefined minimum magnitude. It is designed to filter out noisy fluctuations in price while identifying larger trends in which the market advances or declines by a minimum percentage (D). ZigZag is effective for analyzing historical data, and cannot forecast future trends.\nThe trend lines are drawn when price movement exceeds a distance threshold percentage. A Lowest Low point is recorded once the upward price movement achieves the percentage distance threshold from the low. Conversely, a Highest High point is recorded once the downward price is reached which achieves the minimum percentage magnitude.\nFor OHLC data, the high and low values of the bar are considered. For line and mountain charts, only the close is considered.\nThe final leg of the ZigZag is a proposed line between the last extreme value encountered and the present price."

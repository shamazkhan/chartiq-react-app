   * The following is a set of web components used in our sample templates to illustrate how the API can be leveraged to build a full featured UI to control the chart.
   *
   * Feel free to use them as provided or modify the web components to meet your needs. You can find all of the source code for these components in `js/components.js`
   * and `js/componentUI.js`.
   *
   * This implementation assumes the chart is attached to a quote feed for interactive data loading. If you will not be using a quote feed, you will need to adjust
   * these components accordingly.
   *
   * >Two special tags are required to run the framework:
   * >
   * >`cq-ui-manager` is a component that manages all menus and dialogs on the page. It does so by attaching itself to the HTML body element, monitoring touch and mouse events,
   * and then instantiating menus and dialogs. For instance, when a user taps on the screen, they expect that any open menus will be closed. This is one of the responsibilities
   * that `cq-ui-manager` assumes.
   * > **One cq-ui-manager tag is allowed for the entire page, even when multiple charts are instantiated.**
   * >
   * > `cq-context` is a special tag that groups a set of components to a particular chart. Any component that is nested within a `cq-context` will look to that context
   * in order to find its chart. For instance, menu items within a `cq-context` will interact with the chart engine that is attached to the context.
   *
   * **Performance considerations:** These web components include dynamically updating modules that will react to every data change and redraw certain elements.
   * Although visually pleasing, they can sometimes cause performance issues on slow devices or when multiple charts are displayed.
   * See CIQ.UI.animatePrice for setting options.
   *
   * See CIQ.UI.ContextTag, which provides a model and base functionality for many components
   *
   * See the following tutorial for further details on how to work with and customize the included web components: {@tutorial Web Component Interface}.

     * | attribute    | description |
     * | :----------- | :---------- |

     *
     * `<cq-symbol></cq-symbol>` will display `chart.symbol`.
     * `<cq-symbol-description></cq-symbol-description>` will display the `chart.symbolDisplay`. See CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#symbolDisplay for details on how to set this value.
     *
     * Set attribute `cq-browser-tab` to true to get the stock symbol and latest price to update in the browser tab.
     *
     * Set member `previousClose` to the prior day's closing price in order to calculate and display change.
     * If `previousClose` is not set, then `iqPrevClose` from the `dataSet` will be the default.
     * Remember data is loaded asynchronously.
     * Be sure to reset this value once your initial data has been loaded by using the CIQ.ChartEngine.loadChart callback function.
     * @example <caption>Reset closing price</caption>
     * stx.loadChart(symbol, parameters, function(){
     *      document.querySelector("cq-chart-title").previousClose = yesterdays-closing-price;
     * }
     *
     * The `cq-animate` attribute in the `cq-current-price` element can be used to change the price color to red or green based on the previous value.
     * Setting the attribute to "fade" will introduce a transition effect on the price which, while attractive, uses considerable CPU when there are rapid updates.
     * @example <caption>cq-animate attribute</caption>
     * <cq-chart-title>
     * 	<cq-symbol></cq-symbol>
     * 	<cq-chart-price>
     * 		<cq-current-price cq-animate></cq-current-price>
     * 		<cq-change>
     * 			<div class="ico"></div> <cq-todays-change></cq-todays-change> (<cq-todays-change-pct></cq-todays-change-pct>)
     * 		</cq-change>
     * 	</cq-chart-price>

     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-comparison&gt;</h4>
     *
     * This component presents a legend of comparison series found on the panel.  The legend will by default allow the user to
     * toggle the visibility of the series, remove the series, change the series color, and observe the series's price.
     * From the markup, the developer can configure these options as well as whether to display the current price or the crosshair price.
     *
     * Usually the comparison legend is automatically created by the [cq-study-legend]WebComponents.StudyLegend component.
     * Therefore, you do not have to create this component on your template manually.
     *
     * A comparison series "chooser" can also be created using this tag.  See below example.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component supports the following attributes:
     * | attribute    | description |
     * | :----------- | :---------- |
     * | chart-legend | A flag to indicate that the component should take the form of a legend. |
     * | cq-marker    | Set to true to allow component to be properly positioned on a chart panel. |
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when a series is removed, its properties modified, or its visibility toggled.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction" |
     * | effect | "remove", "modify", "toggle" |
     * | action | "click" |
     * | name | _series key_ |
     * | field | _field_ |
     * | value | _value_ |
     *
     * Note:
     * -  `field` and `value` not available on remove effect
     *
     * This component comes with a default markup which is used when the component tag contains no other markup when it is added to the DOM.
     * The default markup provided has accessibility features.
     *
     * @example <caption>Comparison series "Chooser" markup.  Note the absence of the "chart-legend" attribute.</caption>

     *
     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-dropdown&gt;</h4>
     *
     * This component is a container of menu options which can be scrolled though and selected.  The component is typically revealed
     * after a cq-menu component is opened.  This component is usually nested within a `cq-menu` tag.
     * The items that are listed in the dropdown are specified in a configuration.  See example below.
     * To bind the component's configuration, set its `config` attribute to an object in the CIQ.UI.Context.config.menus object.
     *
     * This component automatically allows for scrolling through its elements, when the size of the list exceeds the dropdown's dimensions.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute   | description |
     * | :---------- | :---------- |
     * | maximize    | Set to true to have the dropdown extend in height to the height of the chart container even when there are not enough items in the dropdown to fill it. |
     * | noresize    | Set to true to prevent resizing of dropdown. Otherwise, sizing is based on number of elements in the dropdown. |
     * | config      | Key pointing to a component configuration entry which specifies the content items. |
     *
     * If no markup is specified in this component, a default markup will be provided.  It is **strongly suggested** to allow the default markup
     * to be used.  In order to use the default markup, the selections in the menu must be configured in the context configuration file and specified
     * by key in the `config` attribute.  See example.
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when an item in the component is toggled, selected, or edited.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction" |
     * | effect |  "toggle", "select", "edit" |
     * | action | "click" |
     * | menu | _menu element which owns this component_ |
     * | params | _properties set in configuration object for the item specified by the action_ |
     *
     * This component comes with a default markup which is used when the component tag contains no other markup when it is added to the DOM.
     * The default markup provided has accessibility features.
     *
     * _**Configuration**_
     *
     * Configuration is accomplished by setting up an object within the context configuration's menus object.  Each menu dropdown is assigned a unique name which is
     * itself an object property of the menus object.  This property name is used as the value of the `config` attribute of the owning menu component.
     * Let's call the object containing the configuration `items`.  `items` will contain a property called `content` whose value is an array.
     * Each array element is an object which represents one item in the dropdown.  Let's call one of these array elements, `item`.
     * Each `item` has several properties which describe the nature of the dropdown item to display.  The following table of properties describes what they mean.
     *
     * | property    | description |
     * | :---------- | :---------- |
     * | type        | Describes what type of item to display.  Valid values are described in the table below. |
     * | label       | Text to display. |
     * | className   | Optional class name to apply to item. |
     * | active      | Set to true to manually set the active state on the item.  Note the active state is usually set with a bound value. |
     * | tap         | Name of helper function to execute when item is clicked. |
     * | setget      | Same as tap except used to bind values when `type` is `radio`, `switch`, or `checkbox`. |
     * | bind        | Name of helper function to execute when binding has changed.  This is not a common option. |
     * | options     | Name of helper function to execute when clicking the options icon, which only appears when this prooperty is set. |
     * | iconCls     | Optional class name of an icon to display on the item. |
     * | value       | Array of arguments to pass to `tap`, `stxget`, or `bind` functions; or, name of component when `type="component"`. |
     * | feature     | Name of add-on to which this option belongs.  If the add-on is not loaded, the option will not appear. |
     * | attributes  | Object containiing attributes for a `type="component"` item. |
     * | selector    | Used to specify the selector for `type="clickable"`. |
     * | method      | Used to specify the method for `type="clickable"`. |
     * | menuPersist | Normally menus close when selecting any item type besides `checkbox` or `switch`.  Setting this property to "true" will keep the menu from closing after selection. |
     * | filterFor   | A label to specify the element to filter.  The element to filter must also have its `filter-name` attribute set to this value.  If `filter-for` is omitted, will filter this element's next sibling. |
     * | filterMin   | The number of filterable records below which the filter input will not appear.  If omitted, filter input will never appear. |
     * | helpId      | A key to the correct help text in CIQ.Help.Content. |
     *
     * Valid `type`s are described here:
     * | type      | description |
     * | :-------- | :---------- |
     * | item      | Standard text which when clicked will execute `tap` or `setget` action via a helper. |
     * | switch    | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a slider switch. |
     * | checkbox  | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a checkbox. |
     * | radio     | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a radio. |
     * | clickable | Embeds a `cq-clickable` which executes an action, usually opening a dialog. |
     * | heading   | Unclickable text displayed in `<h4>` tag.  May be configured to allow filtering of another element's items. |
     * | template  | Embeds markup specified with a `name` attribute equal to this component's `value` attribute. The markup to be embedded needs to be found in the document within a unique template which has the attribute `cq-dropdown-templates`. |
     * | component | Embeds a component specified by `value` with attributes specified by `attributes`.  |
     * | separator | Unclickable horizontal line, used to separate two menu sections. |
     *

     * <cq-dropdown config="example"></cq-dropdown>

     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-heading&gt;</h4>
     *
     * In addition to representing the inner text of this component as an &lt;h4&gt; level header, this component also
     * allows one to filter what is displayed in a list of elements beneath another element in the DOM.  The filtering
     * is triggered by typing into to a search input.
     *
     * Note a MutationObserver is attached to the filterable element so if its contents change, this component will be
     * aware and render accordingly (see `filter-min` below).
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute    | description |
     * | :----------- | :---------- |
     * | filter-for   | A label to specify the element to filter.  The element to filter must also have its _filter-name_ attribute set to this value.  If _filter-for_ is omitted, will filter this element's next sibling. |
     * | filter-label | Text to put in the placeholder of the search input.  If omitted, will use "Search". |
     * | filter-min   | The number of filterable records below which the filter input will not appear.  If omitted, filter input will never appear. |
     * | icon         | Optional icon class name to put on left of filter. |
     * | text         | Heading text.  Appears whether or not filtering is enabled. |
     *
     * Note that the `filter-for` attribute is disregarded if the component's `itemContainer` property is set.  This property should be set to a valid container selector if used.
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component whenever the search input is changed.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.

     * of the symbol's description.  Results of the search are presented in a dropdown for the user to choose.
     *
     * A CIQ.ChartEngine.Driver.Lookup must be connected to this web component. The lookup
     * driver searches financial exchanges for symbols that match the text entered in the
     * component's input field.
     *
     * The symbol lookup can be toggled using the Ctrl+Alt+S keystroke combination (see the
     * `symbolLookup` action in `hotkeyConfig.hotkeys` in *js/defaultConfiguration.js*).

     *   <code class="codeLink">lookupDriver</code></a> property of the chart configuration
     *   object

     *   [setDriver]WebComponents.Lookup#setDriver
     * - Add the driver to the UI context with CIQ.UI.Context#setLookupDriver
     *
     * **Note:** If the lookup component is unable to access a lookup driver, the component's
     * input field is active, but the component does not produce results.
     *
     * _**Keyboard control**_
     *
     * When selected with tab key navigation and activated with Return/Enter, this component has
     * the following internal controls:
     * - Up/Down arrow — Move selection between search input, filters, and search results
     * - Left/Right arrow — Switch between search result filters
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute            | description |
     * | :------------------- | :---------- |
     * | cq-keystroke-default | Enables the component to respond to keystrokes when the lookup input field does not have focus. <p style="margin-bottom: 0">**Warning:** This feature may conflict with keyboard shortcuts set in other components. |
     * | cq-uppercase         | Forces text to uppercase. |
     * | cq-exchanges         | Comma-delimited list of financial exchanges searched by the lookup driver. Overrides the `exchanges` parameter of CIQ.ChartEngine.Driver.Lookup. |
     *
     * In addition, the following attributes are also supported:
     * | attribute            | description |
     * | :------------------- | :---------- |
     * | cq-keystroke-claim   | Enables processing of keyboard input. |
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when a search is performed.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:

     * | :------- | :---- |

     *
     * _**Customization**_
     *
     * - To hide the lookup results window, modify the CSS as follows:
     * ```css
     * .stxMenuActive cq-lookup-results { opacity: 0 }
     * ```
     *
     * - To preload default results (rather than an empty result pane) on initial load, set an
     * `onChartReady` handler in the chart configuration object (see the
     * <a href="tutorial-Chart%20Configuration.html" target="_blank">Chart Configuration</a>
     * tutorial); for example:
     *
     * ```
     * config.onChartReady = (stx) => {
     *     const defaultResults = [
     *         {
     *             "display": ["KW", "Kennedy - Wilson Holdings Inc", "NYSE"],
     *             "data": {
     *                 "symbol": "KW",
     *                 "name": "Kennedy - Wilson Holdings Inc",
     *                 "exchDisp ": "NYSE"
     *             }
     *         },
     *         {
     *             "display": ["RWR", "SPDR Series Trust - SPDR DJ Wilshire REIT ETF", "NYSEArca"],
     *             "data": {
     *                 "symbol": "RWR",
     *                 "name": "SPDR Series Trust - SPDR DJ Wilshire REIT ETF",
     *                 "exchDisp": "NYSEArca"
     *             }
     *         }
     *     ];
     *
     *     const UISymbolLookup = document.querySelector(".ciq-search cq-lookup");
     *     UISymbolLookup.results(defaultResults);
     * }
     * ````
     *
     * - The placeholder is programmatically set based on the width of the chart.
     * On larger screens "Enter Symbol" is used, but on smaller screens only "Symbol" is used.
     * As such, it is not sufficient to set a placeholder value on the HTML, as it will be overwritten by the Web Component logic.
     * The following script will update the placeholder according to breakpoint values set in placeholderMapping.
     * It should be placed inside the [onWebComponentsReady]{@tutorial Chart Configuration} callback provided in the
     * `defaultConfiguration` object to ensure it is executed once all Web Components have been properly initialized.
     * The approach here is to add a second breakpoint channel listener for the lookup component that overwrites the value set by default in the library.
     *
     * ```
     * function setLookupPlaceholders(placeholderMapping = {
     *     "break-lg": "Change symbol",
     *     "break-md": "+ symbol",
     *     "break-sm": ""
     *  }) {
     *   Array.from(uiContext.topNode.querySelectorAll('cq-lookup'))
     *   .forEach(el => {
     *         const { channels = {} } = el.context.config;
     *         el.channelSubscribe(

     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-message-toaster&gt;</h4>
     *
     * Displays pop-up messages, also known as toasts.
     *
     * Listens for a chart engine event of type "notification" and displays the notification as a
     * pop-up message over the chart.
     *
     * To trigger the notification event, call CIQ.ChartEngine#dispatch with the
     * "notification" type and the required notification listener data (see
     * [notificationEventListener]CIQ.ChartEngine~notificationEventListener), for example:
     * ```
     * stxx.dispatch("notification", { message: "A toast!" });
     * ```
     *
     * Toasts are displayed immediately unless another toast is already on screen. Concurrent toasts
     * are displayed sequentially, not simultaneously.
     *
     * When a toast is created, it's added to a display queue. The toast at the front of the queue is
     * dequeued and displayed when no other toasts are on screen. Toasts can be prioritized (that is,
     * reordered in the queue) by setting the `priority` parameter of the
     * [notificationEventListener]CIQ.ChartEngine~notificationEventListener argument.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_:
     *
     * | Name | Description | Valid Values |
     * | ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
     * | `default-display-time` | Amount of time, in seconds, toasts are displayed before being automatically dismissed (removed from the display). | Integer numbers >= 0. A value of 0 causes toasts to remain on screen — blocking the toast display queue — until selected by the user. |
     * | `default-position` | Vertical on-screen position of toasts relative to the chart. (Toasts are centered horizontally.) | "top" or "bottom" |
     * | `default-transition` | Animation used to display and dismiss toasts. | "fade", "slide", "pop" or "drop" | The default is no transition.
     *
     * **Note:** All attributes can be overridden by the argument provided to
     * [notificationEventListener]CIQ.ChartEngine~notificationEventListener.
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when a toast message is dismissed due to either:
     * - click (user interaction)
     * - alert (internal removal request)
     * - timeout (expiration)
     *
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction", "alert", "timeout" |
     * | effect | "remove" |
     * | action | "click", null |
     * | displayTime | _time before automatically dismissing_ |
     * | message | _toast message_ |
     * | priority | _toast priority_ |
     * | type | _toast style_ |
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when a toast message is displayed, or removed from the message queue.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:

     *
     * This component creates a scrollable container, which resizes itself when the screen
     * is resized. If CIQ.UI.scrollbarStyling is initialized to a scrollbar implementation (such as
     * PerfectScrollbar), the scrollbar implementation replaces the native scrollbar.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component supports the following attributes:
     * | attribute      | description |
     * | :------------- | :---------- |
     * | cq-no-claim    | Do not apply any keystroke capturing |
     * | cq-no-maximize | Do not automatically maximize the height (but keep it showing on screen) |
     * | cq-no-resize   | Do not apply any sizing logic |
     * | cq-max-height  | Maximum height |
     *
     * _**Keyboard Control**_
     *
     * When selected with tab key navigation and activated with Return/Enter, this component has the
     * following internal controls:
     * | key              | action |
     * | :--------------- | :----- |
     * | Up/Down arrow    | Move selection between internal cq-item elements. |
     * | Left/Right arrow | Select a control within a selected element. |
     *
     * @example
     * <cq-lookup-results>
     *     <cq-lookup-filters cq-no-close>
     *         <cq-filter class="true">ALL</cq-filter>
     *         <cq-filter>STOCKS</cq-filter>
     *         <cq-filter>FX</cq-filter>
     *         <cq-filter>INDEXES</cq-filter>

     * Let's call the object containing the configuration `items`.  `items` will contain a property called `content` whose value is an array.
     * Each array element is an object which represents one item in the group.  Let's call one of these array elements, `item`.
     * Each `item` has several properties which describe the nature of the range to display.  The following table of properties describes what they mean.
     *

     * | className   | Optional class name to apply to item. |
     * | tap         | Name of helper function to execute when item is clicked. |
     * | iconCls     | Optional class name of an icon to display on the item. |
     * | value       | Array of arguments to pass to `tap` function. |
     * | feature     | Name of add-on to which this option belongs.  If the add-on is not loaded, the option will not appear. |
     * | helpId      | A key to the correct help text in CIQ.Help.Content. |
     * | id          | DOM id for the item. |
     *
     * Valid `type`s are described here:
     * | type      | description |
     * | :-------- | :---------- |
     * | item      | Standard text which when clicked will execute `tap` action via a helper. |

     * - Remove the plot
     * - Disable the plot
     * - Change the color of the plot
     * - Edit study parameters
     * - View comparison prices
     *
     * _**Keyboard control**_
     *
     * When selected with tab key navigation and activated with Return/Enter, this component has
     * the following internal controls:
     * - Up/Down arrow — Move selection between legend entries
     * - Left/Right arrow — Select a control within a selected entry, such as
     * the Remove button. Child elements must have the attribute `keyboard-selectable-child` set to
     * be selectable with these keys.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute        | description |
     * | :--------------- | :---------- |
     * | button-clear-all | Set to a handler to show the Clear All button. Handler will be called when button is pressed. |
     * | button-edit      | Set to enable the edit icon, otherwise, clicking on the plot name will open edit. |
     * | button-remove    | Set to enable the remove icon. |
     * | clone-to-panel   | Set to place this legend on every panel. |
     * | content-keys     | Optional selector for which nodes have content, to indicate if legend is populated.  Default is `"[label],[description]"`. |
     * | filter           | Comma delimited list of types of plots to display. Valid values, which may be combined, are: `panel`, `overlay`, `signal`, `custom-removal` |
     * | heading          | Set to a value to display when legend is embedded in a dropdown menu. |
     * | marker-label     | Set to the name to display on the legend which appears on the chart, e.g. "Plots". |
     * | series           | Set to `true` to include comparisons in the legend. |
     *
     * The filter values are further defined as follows:
     * - `custom-removal`: show studies needing custom removal.
     * - `overlay`: only show overlays.
     * - `panel`: only show studies in this panel.
     * - `signal`: only show signalling studies.
     *
     * In addition, the following attributes are also supported:
     * | attribute    | description |
     * | :----------- | :---------- |
     * | chart-legend | READ ONLY, set internally by component - indicates that legend is on a chart panel, as opposed to embedded in a menu. |
     * | cq-marker    | Set to true to allow legend to be properly positioned on a chart panel. |
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when a legend item is toggled, removed, or edited.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction" |
     * | effect | "toggle", remove", "edit" |
     * | action | "click" |
     * | name | _plot name_ |
     * | value | _enabledstate -or- study inputs, outputs, and parameters_ |
     *
     * Note:
     * -  `detail.value` not available on remove effect
     *
     * This component comes with a default markup which is used when the component tag contains no other markup when it is added to the DOM.

     *
     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-toggle&gt;</h4>
     *
     * When tapped/clicked, this component will toggle through different states.  Each state represents a value of an object's member;
     * for example, the object could be the chart's layout or preferences, while the member could be a property of these objects.
     * If the `member` attribute of the toggle is set, the toggle state is bound to that member, meaning, if the underlying member value
     * is changed, the toggle will change state to reflect that.
     *
     * Use [registerCallback]WebComponents.Toggle#registerCallback to receive a callback
     * every time the toggle changes. When a callback is registered, any automatic class changes are
     * bypassed.
     *
     * To bind the component's configuration, set its `config` attribute to an object in the CIQ.UI.Context.config.toggles object.
     * Using a configuration allows easy customization of callback functions.  See example below.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute      | description |
     * | :------------- | :---------- |
     * | action         | If set to "class" (the default), will set/unset the "active" class on the component when executing callbacks. |
     * | config         | Key pointing to a configuration file entry which specifies the callback functions. |
     * | help-id        | A key to the correct help text in CIQ.Help.Content. |
     * | icon           | Class name for image to use for the toggle. |
     * | member         | Object member to observe. If not provided, then callbacks are used exclusively. |
     * | multichart-distribute | Option for multichart context. Distributes object member change to all charts. |
     * | reader         | Accessibility text when focused by a screen reader. |
     * | stxtap         | Custom click handling which overrides the default toggling functionality. |
     * | toggles        | A comma-separated list of values which are toggled through with each click. The list can include "null". Stringified booleans and "null" are converted to their primitive values. All other values are passed to the Number constructor. If the result is a number (not NaN), the number is used. Otherwise the value is left as a string. |
     * | toggle-classes | A comma-separated list of classes associated with the toggle setting. If a setting requires multiple classes, they need to be separated with spaces. |
     * | tooltip        | Text for the tooltip which appears when hovering over the component. |
     * | value          | The current state of the toggle. |
     *
     * In addition, the following attributes are also supported:
     * | attribute     | description |
     * | :------------ | :---------- |
     * | active-class  | A class name to add to a binary state toggle if it is in an active state. |
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when it is clicked.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction" |
     * | effect | "toggle" |
     * | action | "click" |
     * | value | _value_ |
     *
     * `cause` and `action` are set only when the value is changed as a direct result of clicking on the component.
     *
     * This component comes with a default markup which is used when the component tag contains no other markup when it is added to the DOM.
     * The default markup provided has accessibility features.
     *
     * @example <caption>Toggle bound to layout.crosshair:</caption>
     * <cq-toggle member="layout.crosshair" reader="Crosshair" tooltip="Crosshair (Alt + \)" icon="crosshair"></cq-toggle>
     * @example <caption>Registering a callback function directly:</caption>
     * document.querySelector("cq-toggle").registerCallback(function(value){
     *    console.log("current value is " + value);
     *    if(value != false) this.classList.add("active");
     * });
     * @example <caption>Registering a callback function via the config:</caption>
     * // set the toggle component's config attribute to "example"
     * stxx.uiContext.config.toggles.example.callbacks = [function (value) {
     *    console.log("current value is " + value);
     *    if(value != false) this.classList.add("active");
     * }];

     *  This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     *  <h4>&lt;cq-drawing-palette&gt;</h4>
     *
     * This component is used to facilitate drawing and annotating on the chart. It displays a palette
     * for control and management of drawing tools.
     *
     * Inherits from `<cq-palette>`. Palette components must be placed within a `<cq-palette-dock>` component.
     *
     * This works in conjunction with the [cq-drawing-settings]WebComponents.DrawingSettings component
     * and replaces the cq-toolbar component, providing additional functionality
     * and an improved user experience.
     *
     * Drawing tools support keystroke combinations by setting a `cq-tool-shortcut` attribute in the tool
     * `cq-item` element. Combinations take the form Alt+key (upper- or lowercase); for example, Alt+a or
     * Alt+A — in either case, the key combination works whether the key is shifted or not. Users can also
     * add the modifier Ctrl to the keystroke combination. For example, both Alt+R and Ctrl+Alt+R activate the
     * Rectangle tool. The added Ctrl modifier helps provide a unique keystroke combination in the event the Alt+key
     * combination is assigned to a function in the web browser or to an application on the user's system.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute   | description |
     * | :---------- | :---------- |
     * | view        | Palette display style: "grid" or "list". |
     * | active-tool | Current active drawing tool. |
     * | docked      | The docked state of the palette. Set to "false" to float palette over the chart. |
     *
     * In addition, the following attributes are also supported:
     * | attribute            | description |
     * | :------------------- | :---------- |
     * | cq-keystroke-claim   | Enables processing of keyboard input. |
     *
     * If no markup is specified in the menu component, a default markup will be provided.  It is **strongly suggested** to allow the default markup
     * to be used.
     * The default markup utilizes the drawing tools and grouping options set in the default configuration, which is customizable through the component's `context.config` property.
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted from the component when its view mode is changed.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | effect | "toggle" |
     * | view | _mode_ |
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted from the component when the active tool is changed.

     * This is a custom HtmlElement (Web Component).  The tag name is the following:
     *
     * <h4>&lt;cq-drawing-settings&gt;</h4>
     *
     * Drawing Settings palette web component used to draw and annotate on the chart. Displays a palette
     * along the top of the chart for managing tool settings.
     *
     * Inherits from `<cq-palette>`. Palette components must be placed within a `<cq-palette-dock>` component.
     *
     * This works in conjunction with the [cq-drawing-palette]WebComponents.DrawingPalette component
     * and replaces the cq-toolbar component, providing additional functionality
     * and an improved user experience.
     *
     * _**Attributes**_
     *
     * This component observes the following attributes and will change behavior if these attributes are modified:
     * | attribute    | description |
     * | :----------- | :---------- |
     * | docked       | The docked state of the palette. Set to "false" to float palette over the chart. |
     * | hide         | The hidden state of the palette. Set to "false" to show palette. |
     * | active-tool  | Current active drawing tool. |
     * | axis-label   | "true" to enable axis label. |
     * | line-color   | Current line color in hex format, or "auto" to select color from theme. |
     * | fill-color   | Current fill color in hex format, or "auto" to select color from theme. |
     * | font-family  | Current font name. Note: specified font must be available in the end-user's system. |
     * | font-size    | Current font size in valid css units. |
     * | font-italic  | "true" to enable font italics style. |
     * | font-bold    | "true" to enable font bold style. |
     * | line-width   | Line width in pixels. |
     * | line-pattern | Line pattern: "solid", "dotted" or "dashed". |
     * | show-callout | "true" to enable display of callout. |
     * | span-panels  | "true" to enable span panels. |
     *
     * _**Emitters**_
     *
     * A custom event will be emitted by the component when it is clicked.
     * See CIQ.UI.BaseComponent#emitCustomEvent for details on how to listen for this event.
     * The details of the event contain the following:
     * | property | value |
     * | :------- | :---- |
     * | emitter | this component |
     * | cause | "useraction" |
     * | effect | "select" |
     * | action | "click" |
     * | name | _property_ |
     * | value | _value_ |
     *
     * `cause` and `action` are set only when the value is changed as a direct result of clicking on the component.
     *
     * This component comes with a default markup which is used when the component tag contains no other markup when it is added to the DOM.
     * The default markup provided has accessibility features.
     *
     * @example
     *	<cq-drawing-settings
     *		class="palette-settings"
     *		docked="true"
     *		hide="true"
     *		orientation="horizontal"

   * `<cq-symbol-description></cq-symbol-description>` will display the `chart.symbolDisplay`. See CIQ.ChartEngine.Chart#symbolDisplay for details on how to set this value.
   *
   * Set attribute `cq-browser-tab` to true to get the stock symbol and latest price to update in the browser tab.
   *
   * Set member `previousClose` to the prior day's closing price in order to calculate and display change.
   * If `previousClose` is not set, then `iqPrevClose` from the `dataSet` will be the default.
   * Remember data is loaded asynchronously.
   * Be sure to reset this value once your initial data has been loaded by using the CIQ.ChartEngine.loadChart callback function.

   * The default markup provided has accessibility features.
   *
   * _**Configuration**_
   *
   * Configuration is accomplished by setting up an object within the context configuration's menus object.  Each menu dropdown is assigned a unique name which is
   * itself an object property of the menus object.  This property name is used as the value of the `config` attribute of the owning menu component.
   * Let's call the object containing the configuration `items`.  `items` will contain a property called `content` whose value is an array.
   * Each array element is an object which represents one item in the dropdown.  Let's call one of these array elements, `item`.
   * Each `item` has several properties which describe the nature of the dropdown item to display.  The following table of properties describes what they mean.
   *
   * | property    | description |
   * | :---------- | :---------- |
   * | type        | Describes what type of item to display.  Valid values are described in the table below. |
   * | label       | Text to display. |
   * | className   | Optional class name to apply to item. |
   * | active      | Set to true to manually set the active state on the item.  Note the active state is usually set with a bound value. |
   * | tap         | Name of helper function to execute when item is clicked. |
   * | setget      | Same as tap except used to bind values when `type` is `radio`, `switch`, or `checkbox`. |
   * | bind        | Name of helper function to execute when binding has changed.  This is not a common option. |
   * | options     | Name of helper function to execute when clicking the options icon, which only appears when this prooperty is set. |
   * | iconCls     | Optional class name of an icon to display on the item. |
   * | value       | Array of arguments to pass to `tap`, `stxget`, or `bind` functions; or, name of component when `type="component"`. |
   * | feature     | Name of add-on to which this option belongs.  If the add-on is not loaded, the option will not appear. |
   * | attributes  | Object containiing attributes for a `type="component"` item. |
   * | selector    | Used to specify the selector for `type="clickable"`. |
   * | method      | Used to specify the method for `type="clickable"`. |
   * | menuPersist | Normally menus close when selecting any item type besides `checkbox` or `switch`.  Setting this property to "true" will keep the menu from closing after selection. |
   * | filterFor   | A label to specify the element to filter.  The element to filter must also have its `filter-name` attribute set to this value.  If `filter-for` is omitted, will filter this element's next sibling. |
   * | filterMin   | The number of filterable records below which the filter input will not appear.  If omitted, filter input will never appear. |
   * | helpId      | A key to the correct help text in CIQ.Help.Content. |
   *
   * Valid `type`s are described here:
   * | type      | description |
   * | :-------- | :---------- |
   * | item      | Standard text which when clicked will execute `tap` or `setget` action via a helper. |
   * | switch    | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a slider switch. |
   * | checkbox  | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a checkbox. |
   * | radio     | Same as item except value is bound and displayed with a radio. |
   * | clickable | Embeds a `cq-clickable` which executes an action, usually opening a dialog. |
   * | heading   | Unclickable text displayed in `<h4>` tag.  May be configured to allow filtering of another element's items. |
   * | template  | Embeds markup specified with a `name` attribute equal to this component's `value` attribute. The markup to be embedded needs to be found in the document within a unique template which has the attribute `cq-dropdown-templates`. |
   * | component | Embeds a component specified by `value` with attributes specified by `attributes`.  |
   * | separator | Unclickable horizontal line, used to separate two menu sections. |

   * - To hide the lookup results window, modify the CSS as follows:
   * ```css
   * .stxMenuActive cq-lookup-results { opacity: 0 }
   * ```
   *
   * - To preload default results (rather than an empty result pane) on initial load, set an
   * `onChartReady` handler in the chart configuration object (see the
   * <a href="tutorial-Chart%20Configuration.html" target="_blank">Chart Configuration</a>
   * tutorial); for example:
   *
   * ```
   * config.onChartReady = (stx) => {
   *     const defaultResults = [
   *         {
   *             "display": ["KW", "Kennedy - Wilson Holdings Inc", "NYSE"],
   *             "data": {
   *                 "symbol": "KW",
   *                 "name": "Kennedy - Wilson Holdings Inc",
   *                 "exchDisp ": "NYSE"
   *             }
   *         },
   *         {
   *             "display": ["RWR", "SPDR Series Trust - SPDR DJ Wilshire REIT ETF", "NYSEArca"],
   *             "data": {
   *                 "symbol": "RWR",
   *                 "name": "SPDR Series Trust - SPDR DJ Wilshire REIT ETF",
   *                 "exchDisp": "NYSEArca"
   *             }
   *         }
   *     ];
   *
   *     const UISymbolLookup = document.querySelector(".ciq-search cq-lookup");
   *     UISymbolLookup.results(defaultResults);
   * }
   * ````
   *
   * - The placeholder is programmatically set based on the width of the chart.
   * On larger screens "Enter Symbol" is used, but on smaller screens only "Symbol" is used.
   * As such, it is not sufficient to set a placeholder value on the HTML, as it will be overwritten by the Web Component logic.
   * The following script will update the placeholder according to breakpoint values set in placeholderMapping.
   * It should be placed inside the [onWebComponentsReady]{@tutorial Chart Configuration} callback provided in the
   * `defaultConfiguration` object to ensure it is executed once all Web Components have been properly initialized.
   * The approach here is to add a second breakpoint channel listener for the lookup component that overwrites the value set by default in the library.
   *
   * ```
   * function setLookupPlaceholders(placeholderMapping = {
   *     "break-lg": "Change symbol",
   *     "break-md": "+ symbol",
   *     "break-sm": ""
   *  }) {
   *   Array.from(uiContext.topNode.querySelectorAll('cq-lookup'))
   *   .forEach(el => {
   *         const { channels = {} } = el.context.config;
   *         el.channelSubscribe(
   *            channels.breakpoint || "channel.breakpoint",
   *            (breakPoint) => {
   *                     const symbolValue = placeholderMapping[breakpoint] || "Change symbol";
   *
   *                     const symbolInput = el.querySelector("input");
   *                     symbolInput.setAttribute("placeholder", symbolValue);
   *          );
   *        });
   *     });
   * }
   * setLookupPlaceholders();
   * ```

   * Drawing tools support keystroke combinations by setting a `cq-tool-shortcut` attribute in the tool
   * `cq-item` element. Combinations take the form Alt+key (upper- or lowercase); for example, Alt+a or
   * Alt+A — in either case, the key combination works whether the key is shifted or not. Users can also
   * add the modifier Ctrl to the keystroke combination. For example, both Alt+R and Ctrl+Alt+R activate the
   * Rectangle tool. The added Ctrl modifier helps provide a unique keystroke combination in the event the Alt+key
   * combination is assigned to a function in the web browser or to an application on the user's system.

   *
   * If no markup is specified in the menu component, a default markup will be provided.  It is **strongly suggested** to allow the default markup
